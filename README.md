# 1.Intro #

-This project is very huge, it is designed from Mendeleev's Table;   
-One of it's benefit, amongs others, is to give a boost to a beginner who want to learn a programming language;   
-Here you'll find five big types of programming languages/frameworks and an evaluation for each (from my perspective...).   
***

# 2.Description #

-I arranged 118 programming languages/frameworks in five big domains, for Software Developers, Web Developers, Scripting Developers, Database Developers, and for Old Developers(big like for them, they began with Fortran, COBOL, Pascal...);  
-The table is designed in that way to give you a fast summary of each programming language/framework, including an analyze about abstraction capability, efficiency power, and philosophy of simplicity, each of them with a note from a scale between 1 to 10...    
-The main idea of this app is given by the amount of the programming languages/frameworks arranged to give a fresh and a fast knwoledge (use the mouse cursor to hover everything to find more about each section of the app).    

# 3.Conclusion #

-A big desktop app, with a modern UI/UX, with some transitions, all of them maded in C# Windows Forms, a good way to make a Desktop App;   
-The purpose of this app is educational, everybody can learn something, it can give you a reason or not to try to learn a programming language or framework...

<b>INFO: </b>Personally, I don't know all of those 118 programming languages/frameworks, but through my entire experience, I'm able to make a summary for them, to analyze them, and to gather information about all of them, even there are not perfect, it's just my opinion, nothing more, nothing less...
